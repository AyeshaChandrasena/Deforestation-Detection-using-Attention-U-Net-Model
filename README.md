# Deforestation-Detection-Model

This project is a analysis of the performance of Attention U-Net at the detecting deforestation in Sri Lanka for Galenbindunuwewa Region using satellite images.

Below image displays the Attention U-Net architecure.

The attention U-Net model performs well with 84 % accuracy for test data with high precision and recall values as shown in below. Moreover, the figure 1 illustrates the training and validation IoU while the figure 2 illustrates training and validation loss for the model. Furthermore, the model performs 84% accuracy for validation and training data with 62% of jaccard coefficient value. The below training history graphs illustrates that the attention U-Net model generalizes well for training and validation data. The findings of this study contributes to more efficient monitoring in deforestation which leads to identify damaged forests.
